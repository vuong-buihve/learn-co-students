JavaScript GitHub API with XHR
---

## Objectives

1. Practice making HTTP requests with XHR
2. Practice doing things with XHR responses

## Introduction

Walk students through the GitHub API docs a little bit -- it's totally okay, at the same time, to give them "homework" to read up more on their own

## Implementation

Since we don't want to bog them down with authentication yet, we should just be doing basic GET requests against repositories that don't need auth. The tests should be mocked out, but students should be working against the real API.

## Resources
